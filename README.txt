STRING:
	*Reads inputs from strdata.txt 
	*strdata.txt contains data in the format "fun_name arguments expected_output"
	*It matches expected_output to the original output and prints the message
	*It creates "string" as executalble file
	*run ./string

	*Reads inputs from wchardata.txt 
	*wchardata.txt contains data in the format "fun_name arguments expected_output"
	*It matches expected_output to the original output and prints the message
	*It creates "wchar" as executalble file
